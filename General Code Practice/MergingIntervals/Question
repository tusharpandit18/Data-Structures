Merge Overlapping Intervals


Given a list of meeting times, checks if any of them overlaps. 
The follow-up question is to return the minimum number of rooms required to accommodate all the meetings.

Letâ€™s start with an example. 
Suppose we use interval (start, end) to denote the start and end time of the meeting, 
we have the following meeting times: (1, 4), (5, 6), (8, 9), (2, 6).

In the above example, apparently we should return true 
for the first question since (1, 4) and (2, 6) have overlaps. 
For the follow-up question, we need at least 2 meeting rooms so that 
(1, 4), (5, 6) will be put in one room and (2, 6), (8, 9) will be in the other.
